STs of E. coli. The x-axis depicts ST lineage, while the y-axis depicts antitoxin groups 
identified. The color bar on the right side depicts % presence.

coli. The x-axis depicts ST lineage, while the y-axis depicts the TA pair identified. The color 
bar on the right side depicts % presence.

hits and green-colored nodes depicting antitoxin partners, while edges represent 
association between TA pairs.
